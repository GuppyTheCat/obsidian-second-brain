# Cursor Rules Maintenance

- **Update Cursor Rules:** Whenever you make significant changes to the codebase structure, workflow patterns, or conventions, YOU MUST update these cursor rules:
  - Adding new utility patterns or script organization
  - Establishing new coding conventions
  - Creating new documentation requirements
  - Changing how certain file types should be handled
  - Adding new categories or templates
  - Refactoring scripts or utilities (see Scripts section for template/note updates)

- **Rule Updates:** When updating cursor rules, ensure:
  - Rules are clear and actionable
  - Examples are provided where helpful
  - Rules follow the established structure and formatting
  - Related rules are grouped together logically
