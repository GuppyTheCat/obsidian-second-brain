# Cursor Rules - Second Brain

This is the main rule index for Cursor AI assistance in the Second Brain project. Rules are organized into focused sections for better maintainability.

## Quick Navigation

- **[General Rules](sections/general.md)** - Coding principles and query priorities
- **[Documentation](sections/documentation.md)** - Documentation requirements and structure updates
- **[Templates](sections/templates.md)** - Templater syntax and frontmatter conventions
- **[Scripts](sections/scripts.md)** - Script organization, utilities, and development patterns
- **[Maintenance](sections/maintenance.md)** - How to maintain and update these cursor rules

## Overview

These rules ensure consistency, maintainability, and best practices across the Second Brain codebase. When working with this project:

1. **Read the relevant section(s)** before making changes
2. **Follow established patterns** for scripts, templates, and documentation
3. **Update documentation** when making structural changes
4. **Update these rules** when establishing new conventions

## Key Principles

- Prioritize clarity and maintainability
